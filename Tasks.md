## Decisions

What variables to use from NOAA?
What stations to use from NOAA?

Should we include Lake St. Clair?
    it's in the ice coverage but not in the stats.
How to identify the separate lakes in NOAA

What plots to create?

Who is presenting


## Tasks

### Lake Ice Notebook
Convert Date column to DateTime
include Lake St. Clair
    In the aggregate in the basin csv (Great Lakes + Lake St. Clair Cover)
    Subtract the sum of the other lakes and save the result in the new Lake St. Clair column
    ACTUALLY the link provided in the second cell has the clair data in a separate file, if we wanna do 
Make Date Column index?


### Lake Stats Notebook
Remove imperial unit rows
remove Totals column
