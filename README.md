## NOAA API 

Documentation: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2#gettingStarted
get API here: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token

A lot of data is here: https://www.glerl.noaa.gov//data/dashboard/data/
csv and other formats

ice data: https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/dashboard/data/ice/

other water data (precipitation, evaporation, etc): https://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/dashboard/data/hydroIO/

Storm data: https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/swdi/stormevents/csvfiles/
(because I found it, we don't have to use it.)

### Lake stats

the 'dirty' dataset (not sure it counts, but the api calls from NOAA may)
